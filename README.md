# WRLS

A performant, lightweight Rust implementation of a **Weighted Recursive Least Squares (WRLS)** adaptive filter.

This crate provides a simple and efficient way to perform online linear regression. It's ideal for applications where data arrives in a stream and the model needs to adapt to changing system dynamics over time, such as in real-time control systems, signal processing, or financial modeling.
